#1 take argparse argument for directory/path (maybe use sysargv instead, no need to unit test this)
#2 create function to get the size of that directory and subfolders/files in it (make sure this only needs to take in the argparse input)
#3 create a function for the conversion portion (do this with the code on the pc and make sure it only takes in one argument
#4 create a function that uses all outputs of the previous 2 functions and puts them into 1 print statement instead
